🎯 Core Concepts

Optimistic UI

This app demonstrates Optimistic UI updates, meaning UI interactions reflect immediately, even before the server responds, providing a smoother experience. This is particularly useful in e-commerce actions like adding products to the cart, where speed is key for conversion.

Server-Side Rendering & Static Generation

We leverage SSR and SSG to enhance SEO and improve initial page load speed. Some pages are server-rendered for up-to-date content (like product listings), while others are statically generated for optimal performance.

Server Actions

The app uses Next.js Server Actions to offload work to the server while keeping the UI responsive, ensuring mutation requests like adding to the cart, wishlists, and more happen instantly on the UI side, with the backend handling it in parallel.
